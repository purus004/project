            <h2>Plant Diseases in Commercial Floriculture</h2>
            <p>Plant diseases are one of the most significant challenges in commercial floriculture. They can cause extensive damage to flowers, reducing yield and quality. These diseases are caused by fungi, bacteria, viruses, and environmental stressors.</p>
            <h3>Common Plant Diseases</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Fungal infections like powdery mildew and rust.</li>
                <li>Bacterial blight, which affects the vascular system of plants.</li>
                <li>Viral diseases, such as mosaic virus, which causes deformed growth.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Prevention and Treatment</h3>
            <p>Preventive measures include crop rotation, disease-resistant varieties, and proper sanitation. Treatments can include fungicides and biological control methods.</p>

            <h2>Cultivation of Flowers</h2>
            <p>Commercial flower cultivation involves selecting the right varieties, ensuring proper soil management, and taking care of the plants throughout their growth stages. It is essential to maintain proper spacing, temperature, and humidity levels for optimal growth.</p>
            <h3>Popular Flower Varieties</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Roses</li>
                <li>Chrysanthemums</li>
                <li>Tulips</li>
                <li>Orchids</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Best Practices for Flower Cultivation</h3>
            <p>Best practices include soil preparation, ensuring adequate irrigation, and proper use of fertilizers. It's also essential to regularly monitor plant health to prevent diseases and pests.</p>

        <section id="fertilizers" class="component-slide">
            <h2>Fertilizers for Flower Growth</h2>
            <p>Fertilizers provide essential nutrients to the plants. They help in promoting growth, flowering, and overall plant health. Fertilizers can be organic or synthetic, each with its own benefits.</p>
            <h3>Types of Fertilizers</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Organic fertilizers like compost and manure.</li>
                <li>Synthetic fertilizers, such as nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium-based fertilizers.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Application Methods</h3>
            <p>Fertilizers can be applied in various ways, such as soil application, foliar spraying, or through fertigation systems. The method depends on the plant's needs and environmental conditions.</p>

        <section id="pest-management" class="component-slide">
            <h2>Pest Management in Commercial Floriculture</h2>
            <p>Pests can be a major threat to flower production, affecting both yield and quality. Effective pest management strategies are essential to minimize damage and maintain healthy crops.</p>
            <h3>Common Pests</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Aphids</li>
                <li>Spider mites</li>
                <li>Whiteflies</li>
                <li>Leafhoppers</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Integrated Pest Management (IPM)</h3>
            <p>IPM involves a combination of biological control, physical barriers, chemical treatments, and cultural practices to manage pest populations without harming the environment.</p>

        <section id="water-management" class="component-slide">
            <h2>Water Management in Commercial Floriculture</h2>
            <p>Water is a vital resource for the growth of flowers. Proper water management ensures that plants receive the right amount of water without wastage.</p>
            <h3>Types of Irrigation Systems</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Drip irrigation: delivers water directly to the root zone.</li>
                <li>Sprinkler systems: suitable for large areas.</li>
                <li>Flood irrigation: used in certain climates or soil types.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Water Quality and Management</h3>
            <p>Water quality should be monitored for parameters like pH, salinity, and nutrient content to prevent issues like waterlogging or poor plant growth. Efficient irrigation practices help in reducing water wastage and improving plant health.</p>
